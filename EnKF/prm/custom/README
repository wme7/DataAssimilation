This directory contains:
  - custom parameter files with particular suggested setups for each model.
    These include:
      prm-custom-LA.txt
      prm-custom-L3.txt
      prm-custom-L40.txt
      prm-custom-L40p.txt
      prm-custom-QG.txt
    There is no need to edit those unless you want to change the system 
    behaviour;
  - parameter files for the full-size QG model (129 x 129):
      QG.prm
      QG-ens.prm
  - parameter file for QGs - "small" QG model (65 x 65):
      QGs.prm
  - parameter file for QGt - "tiny" QG model (33 x 33):
      QGt.prm

    Modifying parameter files for the QG model changes the model behaviour. Do 
    not touch them unless you have a specific reason for that.

Note: I have noticed that the full-size QG model became unstable with the latest
samples available from http://enkf.nersc.no/Code/EnKF-Matlab/QG_samples .
Because of that, simultaneously with releasing EnKF-Matlab v. 0.16 the sample
will be reverted to prior ones, that resulted in much more stable runs. Beware
that these earlier samples are the dumps from a long run with r = 2e-5.

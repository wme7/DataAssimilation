The L40p model is a modification of the L40 model designed to
demonstrate parameter estimation with ensemble Kalman filter. Specifically,
the magnitude of the forcing is no longer set to a constant value of 8, but 
varies between 7 and 9. The state vector is augmented by one element to 
include the forcing magnitude, and the initial ensemble is generated from states
obtained from a long run with varying magnitude of forcing.

Because there is no assumed dynamics for the parameter during the propagation, 
each assimilation cycle reduces the spread of the estimated parameter. This 
process is balanced by the inflation, which is specified via inflation_prm 
parameter.

One can compare how this augmented system performs versus the non-augmented 
system. The easiest way to do that (to run the true field with varying forcing
but set the ensemble forcing to a constant value) is to set the value of forcing
equal in all ensemble members, e.g. insert

E(end, :) = 8;

just after the initialisation in main.m .

Good luck,

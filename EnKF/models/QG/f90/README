This directory contains Fortran90 code for the QG model for building

(1) a standalone binary;
(2) Matlab binary for conducting a single step of the QG model in when used
    for data assimilation (DA) experiments with the package kalman-matlab.

To build a standalone binary one needs a F90 compiler (tested with g95) and 
netcdf libraries. Edit the Makefile and run:
	make

This should compile the binary "qg" which then can be used for making QG model 
runs. This is a necessary prerequisitive for conducting DA experiments because 
it the initial ensemble is composed of dumps from a long run.

To bild a Matlab binary, in Matlab run the command from mexcmd.m.

To create a collection of samples necessary for DA experiments (by memory):

1. Build "qg" binary
        Note: you may need to change Makefile. In particular, FC (for F90
        compiler) and FCFLAGS. In particular, with g95, you may need to play
        with underscore options in FCFLAGS to match those of your version of the
        NetCDF libraries - search G95Manual.pdf for "undescore" to see available
        options.
2. Run:
	./qg prm.txt
	./qg prm-ens.txt
3. In Matlab run:
	psi = qgread('qg_samples-r=1e-5,dt=1.0,RKH2=2e-12.nc');
	[n_sample, ni, nj] = size(psi);
	n = ni * nj;
	S = reshape(psi, n_sample, n)';
	save 'QG_samples-12.mat' S n_sample n;
	psi = qgread('qg_samples-r=1e-5,dt=1.0,RKH2=2e-11.nc');
	[n_sample, ni, nj] = size(psi);
	n = ni * nj;
	S = reshape(psi, n_sample, n)';
	save 'QG_samples-11.mat' S n_sample n;
4. ln -s QG_samples*.mat ../../../samples

The output of the model can be visualised in Matlab e.g.:
	fname = 'qg_samples-r=1e-5,dt=1.0,RKH2=2e-12.nc';
	[psi, q, psimean, qmean, t] = qgread(fname);
To see dump #10:
	nr = 10;
	qgplot(psi(nr, :, :), q(nr, :, :));
To see the mean fields:
	qgplot(psimean, qmean);
To see the movie:
	qgplay(psi, q, t, 0.2);

The L40b model is yet another modification of the L40 model (along with L40p)
designed to demonstrate parameter estimation with ensemble Kalman filter.
Unlike L40p that estimates changing magnitude of the forcing parmeter, L40b
estimates changing observation bias. Similarly to L40p, the state vector is 
augmented by one element to include the bias estimate.

Because there is no assumed dynamics for the parameter during the propagation, 
each assimilation cycle reduces the spread of the estimated parameter. This 
process is balanced by the inflation, which is specified via inflation_prm 
parameter.

Good luck,
Pavel

* Before running experiments with L3:

  If you are on other platform than Linux x86_64, you need either to compile 
  L3_step_c (in Matlab run "mex L3_step_c.c") or set l.3 in L3_setup.m to 
  "if 1 == 1". (Note that running compiled code is faster. There is also a
  small numerical difference.)

* Before running experiments with L40:

  If you are on other platform than Linux x86_64, you need either to compile 
  L40_step_c (in Matlab run "mex L40_step_c.c") or set l.2 in L40_setup.m to 
  "if 1 == 1".

* Convention for this document: settings marked with the "*" in the end of the
  line need to be returned to the initial value after the run.

1. To reproduce results in Table 1:

-- run.m, l. 6: set "model = 1;"
-- L3_setup.m, l. 17: set "SETUP = <setup #>;", where setup # = {1,...,8}
-- run "run" with each of 8 settings

2. To reproduce Figure 1:

-- run.m, l. 6: set "model = 1;"
-- L3_setup.m, l. 17: set "SETUP = 2;"
-- L3_setup.m, l. 21: set "prm.doplot = 1;" *
-- L3_setup, l. 30: set "prm.nspinup = 100;" *
-- L3_setup, l. 30: set "prm.ncycle = 200;" *
-- run "run"
-- run "plot_100"

3. To reproduce results in Table 2:

-- run.m, l. 6: set "model = 1;"
-- L3_setup.m, l. 17: set "SETUP = <setup #>;", where setup # = {9,...,16}
-- run "run" with each of 8 settings

4. To reproduce results in Table 3:

-- set run.m, l. 6 to "model = 2;"
-- L40_setup.m, l. 15: set "SETUP = <setup #>;", where setup # = {1,...,8}
-- run "run"

5. To reproduce Figure 2:

-- run_batch.m, l. 3: set "METHOD = <method #>;", where method # = {1,2,3}
-- run "run_batch"

*  It takes a while (many hours) to calculate. If you have a multi-processor,
   machine you can run the above 3 instances in parallel. You also can run 3
   more instances by setting "REVERSE = 1;" on l. 4 of run_batch.m

-- run "plot_batch".

6. To reproduce results in Table 4:

-- set run.m, l. 6 to "model = 2;"
-- L40_setup.m, l. 15: set "SETUP = <setup #>;", where setup # = {9-14,16,
   19-23}
-- run "run4"

* Note that inflation is set to NaN for SETUP = {15,17,18}. Set it to a
  finite value if you wish to try these settings. 

7. To reproduce Figure 3:

-- set run.m, l. 6 to "model = 2;"
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 15 to "SETUP = 2;"
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 20 to "prm.calc_norms = 1;" *
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 181: set "if 1 == 1" *
-- run "run"

Note that the last line in the run summary gives the mean of
||T^-1|| * ||A_1^f|| / ||A_2^f|| that is referred to in the Experiment 4 
section. To obtain it for the EnKF and EKF systems repeat this run with
 L40_setup.m, l. 14 set to "SETUP = 1;" and "SETUP = 3;"

8. To reproduce Figure 4:

-- set run.m, l. 6 to "model = 2;"
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 15 to "SETUP = 19;"
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 20 to "prm.calc_norms = 1;" *
-- set L40_setup.m, l. 181 to "if 1 == 1" *
-- run "run"

9. To reproduce results in Table 5:

-- set run.m, l. 6 to "model = 2;"
-- L40_setup.m, l. 15: set "SETUP = <setup #>;", where setup # = {24,...,31}
-- run "run"
